random permutation of a string, inversion pairs, random sample from a infinite data stream
1, Implement postorder traversal - most people will use recursion, I did so. 
2, Follow-up: Not to use recursion but use for/while loop. 
3, write a function for the for/while loop to get the next pointer with the current pointer as the input.
